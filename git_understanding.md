# Git Understanding - Pull Request Learning Exercise

## What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a fundamental feature in Git-based version control platforms like GitHub that enables collaborative software development. It's a formal way to propose changes to a codebase, allowing developers to:

- Submit code changes for review before they're merged into the main branch
- Facilitate discussion and collaboration around proposed changes
- Maintain code quality through peer review
- Track the history of changes and decisions
- Enable safe integration of features and bug fixes

## Initial Learning Notes

This document will be updated with reflections on:
- Why PRs are important in team workflows
- What makes a well-structured PR
