# Branch Experiment

This file was created on the `feature/git-branching-experiment` branch to demonstrate how branches work.

## Branch-Specific Content

- **Branch Name**: feature/git-branching-experiment
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate branching workflow and isolation
- **Created**: During Git branching learning exercise

## Changes Made on This Branch

1. Created this new file (`branch_experiment.md`)
2. Will modify an existing file to show branch isolation
3. Will commit these changes to this branch only

## Expected Behavior

When I switch back to `main` branch:
- This file should not exist on main
- Any modifications to existing files should not be visible on main
- The branches maintain separate histories until merged

This demonstrates the power of Git branching for:
- Feature development isolation
- Experimental changes
- Collaborative development
- Code review processes
